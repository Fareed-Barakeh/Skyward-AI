# Skyward-AI
Skyward AI is a two-player strategy game where each player commands airplanes with limited rockets to outmaneuver and destroy the opponentâ€™s fleet. It features a heuristic AI using Minimax, with planned Alpha-Beta pruning and future neuro-symbolic AI integration for deeper, adaptive play.
